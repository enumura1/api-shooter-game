## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (1.70 or later)

api-shooter
```

## üéØ How to Play

### Controls
- **WASD** or **Arrow Keys**: Move your spaceship
- **1**: Fire GET bullet (scan enemy for weakness)
- **2**: Fire POST bullet (medium damage)
- **3**: Fire PUT bullet (high damage)
- **4**: Fire DELETE bullet (ultimate attack, limited ammo)
- **ESC**: Quit game
- **SPACE**: Continue to next enemy (after victory)

### Gameplay Tips
1. **Always scan first**: Use GET (key 1) to reveal enemy weaknesses
2. **Exploit weaknesses**: Use the revealed weakness for critical hits
3. **Manage ammo**: DELETE is powerful but limited - use wisely
4. **Stay mobile**: Dodge incoming HTTP error attacks
